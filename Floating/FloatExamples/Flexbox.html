    <h3>However, Equal Height Boxes not very flexible. It is ok if you can guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in them. But many times, the content is not the same. If you try the Equal Height Boxes on a mobile phone, you will see that the second box's content will be displayed outside of the box.

    <h2>Using Flexbox to create flexible boxes:</h2>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="box">Box 1 - This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall.</div>
        <div class="box">Box 2 - My height will follow Box 1.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Try to resize the browser window to see the flexible layout</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Flexbox is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 or earlier versions.</p>
