    <h1>(picture) Element</h1>

    <h3>The HTML (picture) element gives web developers more flexiblity in specifying image resources.</h3>

    <h3>The most common use of the (picture) element will be for images used in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.</h3>

    <h3>The (picture) element works similar to the (video) and (audio) elements. You set up different sources, and the first source that fits the preferences is the one being used:</h3>

    <picture>
        <source srcset="../../src/images/img_smallflower.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">
        <source srcset="../../src/images/img_flowers.jpg">
        <img src="../../src/images/img_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" style="width: auto;">
    </picture>

    <h3>The srcset attribute is required, and defines the source of the image.</h3>

    <h3>The media attribute is optional, and accepts the media queries you find in CSS @media rule.</h3>

    <h3>You should also define an (img) element for browsers that do not support the (picture) element.</h3>
