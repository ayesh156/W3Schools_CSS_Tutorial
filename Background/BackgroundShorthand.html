    <h3>To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.</h3>

    <h3>When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>background-color</li>
        <li>background-image</li>
        <li>background-repeat</li>
        <li>background-attachment</li>
        <li>background-position</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the example below, as it does not have a value</h3>
