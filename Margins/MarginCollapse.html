    <h3>Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins</h3>

    <h3>This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!</h3>

    <h2>Demonstration of margin collapse:</h2><br>

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>

    <h3>In the example above, the (h1) element has a bottom margin of 50px and the (h2) element has a top margin set 20px.</h3>

    <h3>Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the (h1) and the (h2) would be a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px</h3>
